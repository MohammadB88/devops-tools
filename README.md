# devops-tools
In this repository, I will gather information about the requirements and installation steps for devops tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Jenkins, ArgoCD and ....
I will also document how to lunch and reach these services on a Kubernetes Cluster.

## Prometheus and Grafana
Using Â Prometheus Operator, I have deplyod Prometheus and Grafana to monitor different cluster metrices. This article is very detailed:

https://computingforgeeks.com/setup-prometheus-and-grafana-on-kubernetes/

Every time, I will clone the latest version of the operator and deploy the prometheus and grafana. 
Current Version: ?? 01.02.2023

After the installation and in order to connect to the Grafana UI, its the service should be exposed on a port of a host VM as
```
kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward svc/grafana HOSST_PORT:SVC_PORT  --address IP_VM 
```

The UI for Prometheus and Alertmanager can be accessed in the same way:

```
kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-k8s HOSST_PORT:SVC_PORT  --address IP_VM 

kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward svc/alertmanager-main HOSST_PORT:SVC_PORT  --address IP_VM 
```

One can also reach these services through a Load Balancer or change the service types to NodePort and also store the data on a PersistentVolume. However, I will focus at the moment on the functionality a of the tools and leave these explorations for later.
