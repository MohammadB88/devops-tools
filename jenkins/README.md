# Kubernetes Manifests for Jenkins Deployment

Refer to [Setup Jenkins On Kubernetes](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/) for step by step process to use these manifests.

If you donâ€™t want the local storage persistent volume, you can replace the volume definition in the deployment with the host directory as shown below.
```
volumes:
- name: jenkins-data
  emptyDir: {}
```

Otherwise volume manifest shloud also be deployed, in which the name of the node that Jenkin's pod runs on has to be set for ***PV***:
```
nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - NODENAME
```

***However, enabling docker inside Jenkins to build images is a tedious tasks***

Docker *client* and *daemon* are required to run docker whitin Jenkis based on [best practice using docker inside Jenkins](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50237433/best-practice-using-docker-inside-jenkins).

Client component can be installed when the custom Jenkins image is prepared ("docker-in-docker approach"), as discussed vastly in below links: 
- [How to build docker images inside a Jenkins container](https://medium.com/@manav503/how-to-build-docker-images-inside-a-jenkins-container-d59944102f30)
- [Jenkins in Docker: Running Docker in a Jenkins Container](https://hackmamba.io/blog/2022/04/running-docker-in-a-jenkins-container/)

Here is the Dockerfile to create the custom Jenkins image:
```
from jenkinsci/jenkins:lts
 
USER root
RUN apt-get update -qq \
    && apt-get install -qqy apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common 

RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -

RUN add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

RUN apt-get update  -qq \
    && apt-get -y install docker-ce

RUN usermod -aG docker jenkins

RUN echo "jenkins ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

USER jenkins
```
  
Another solution is to use the docker client from the host machine which is not that stable and discussed in details in:
- [Using docker in a dockerized Jenkins container](https://forums.docker.com/t/using-docker-in-a-dockerized-jenkins-container/322)

Basically, using volume mount feature, docker client on the host will be linked inside the jenkins kubernetes manifest:
```
  volumeMounts:
    - name: docker-client
      mountPath: /usr/bin/docker
  volumes:
    - name: docker-client
      hostPath:
        path: /usr/bin/docker
        type: File
```

or directly in docker run:
````
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(which docker):$(which docker) -p 8080:8080 jenkins-docker
````


```
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 -v /smb/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins-docker
```
