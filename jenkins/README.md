# Kubernetes Manifests for Jenkins Deployment

Refer [Setup Jenkins On Kubernetes](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/) for step by step process to use these manifests.

If you donâ€™t want the local storage persistent volume, you can replace the volume definition in the deployment with the host directory as shown below.
```
volumes:
- name: jenkins-data
  emptyDir: {}
```
Otherwise the name of the node that Jenkin's pod runs on should be set in the volume manifest for ***PV***:
```
nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - NODENAME
```
